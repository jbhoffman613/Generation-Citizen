# Generation-Citizen
This is a copy of a school project for the organization Generation Citizen. 
We created a mobile up using ReactNative for a front end, and Node.JS for our backend. 

Most of what I worked on cane be found under jbhoffman613/Generation-Citizen/GenerationCitizen/src/bundles/
For this project, I attempeted to learn and work in ReactNative. While I had never worked with JavaScript beforehand andit is far from my strongest language, I learned a lot throughout the process.
